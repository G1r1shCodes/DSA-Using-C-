# 🐱 Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet Solutions by Girish

Welcome to my purr-sonal coding journey through the [Striver’s A2Z DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2)!  
This repo is a structured collection of C++ solutions, following the **Step-by-Step DSA Roadmap** — from basic programming to advanced DSA topics.

Let’s conquer DSA one problem at a time… with a few cats by our side 😺
